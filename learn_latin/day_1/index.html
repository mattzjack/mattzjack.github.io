    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>What you should know about Latin today is that it is a language in the indo-european family. It was once spoken by the Romans, and is now extinct. Note that Latin learning is hard: the nouns changes; the adjectives changes; the verbes changes. To give you a feeling, a typical verb can change into 140 different forms under different circunstances. So... have fun! And don't give up. Colonel Vibius Vibidius Zosimus is on your side.</p>
    <h2>Getting a name</h2>
    <p>Getting a Latin name will be your very first step toward Latin learning. You can pick, amongst millions of combinations, from Wikipedia pages, or you can download the random-Latin-name generator written in python by me.</p>
